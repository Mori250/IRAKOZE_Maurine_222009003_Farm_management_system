                purpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database that have been described above and how it copes with a fully analyzed system.</li>
                <li><h3>Tools used to develop this system in java programming:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eclipse IDE: an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and, until 2016, was the most popular.</li>
                    <li>JAR stands for Java Archive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and
                        is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components.
